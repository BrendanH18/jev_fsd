## Unreleased

- Building footprints occlude the ego's observations, predictions, and emergency brake. Fog,
  rain, and snow shorten sensing range; signal phases outside sight are unknown. Speed planning
  and candidate filtering use visible stopping room, including blind bends.
- Traffic can reserve a vacant curb bay and park at low speed. Parked cars open animated
  street-side doors with matching collision shapes; traffic reacts to the panels.
- Pull-outs leave more room for approaching traffic. NPC path recovery preserves the moving
  body's position and velocity.
- Jev weighs progress, clearance, comfort, roadside activity, and driving style instead of being
  directed to copy the Rules target-speed preference. Mid-block crossings distinguish approach,
  hold, and clearing the car's path. Candidates report comfort and clearance estimates.
- Eleven committed decision cases are generated through the actual driver pipeline. The snapshot
  checker validates requests offline and checks model expectations when a key is available.
- Live Jev behavior remains unverified; historical benchmark numbers describe the earlier world.

## 0.2.0

A large realism and graphics update. The Rules benchmark (seed 1) still passes 12 of 12 drives in
dry, rain, fog, and snow.

### Graphics
- Time of day with the sun's real path over Vancouver, a dawn and dusk sky, stars, and a moon.
- Ambient occlusion, bloom, and antialiasing, with low, high, and ultra quality settings.
- After dark: street lights with light pools, headlights (real beams on the driven car), tail
  lights, and lit windows. Wet roads mirror the street.
- New trees (leafy crowns that sway and cast dappled shadows), rounder cars with better lights,
  jointed pedestrians and helmeted cyclists, porches, chimneys and hedges, raised curbs, and
  pedestrian signal heads. A hood camera.
- The North Shore mountains, English Bay, downtown, Stanley Park, and the city around the map.

### Simulation
- Signal timing plans from approach speeds (ITE yellow, clearance all-red, walk and flashing hand).
- Drivers with individual temperaments; traffic waits for a gap at two-way stops and backs off from
  nose-to-nose standoffs. Parked cars sometimes pull out.
- Pedestrians sometimes cross mid-block, react to cars that will not stop, and walk at different
  speeds; fewer are out at night.
- Power-limited acceleration, drag, and rolling resistance in the car model.
- The planner anticipates lower speed limits, approaches stops at the target speed, and no longer
  treats a passing oncoming car as the car ahead.

### Fixed
- Traffic could pull out of a two-way stop in front of oncoming cars.
- Two cars could wait for each other indefinitely.
- The chase camera could jump when frames were advanced by hand in headless runs.

### Project
- New Rules baseline run, a new README, and 11 new browser tests.

## 0.1.0

First release: the simulator, the Jev and Rules drivers, the decision panel, and the benchmark.
