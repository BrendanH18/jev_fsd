# Changelog

## 0.2.0

A large realism and graphics update. The Rules benchmark (seed 1) still passes 12 of 12 drives in
dry, rain, fog, and snow.

### Graphics
- Time of day with the sun's real path over Vancouver, a dawn and dusk sky, stars, and a moon.
- Ambient occlusion, bloom, and antialiasing, with low, high, and ultra quality settings.
- After dark: street lights with light pools, headlights (real beams on the driven car), tail
  lights, and lit windows. Wet roads mirror the street.
- New trees (leafy crowns that sway and cast dappled shadows), rounder cars with better lights,
  jointed pedestrians and helmeted cyclists, porches, chimneys and hedges, raised curbs, and
  pedestrian signal heads. A hood camera.
- The North Shore mountains, English Bay, downtown, Stanley Park, and the city around the map.

### Simulation
- Signal timing plans from approach speeds (ITE yellow, clearance all-red, walk and flashing hand).
- Drivers with individual temperaments; traffic waits for a gap at two-way stops and backs off from
  nose-to-nose standoffs. Parked cars sometimes pull out.
- Pedestrians sometimes cross mid-block, react to cars that will not stop, and walk at different
  speeds; fewer are out at night.
- Power-limited acceleration, drag, and rolling resistance in the car model.
- The planner anticipates lower speed limits, approaches stops at the target speed, and no longer
  treats a passing oncoming car as the car ahead.

### Fixed
- Traffic could pull out of a two-way stop in front of oncoming cars.
- Two cars could wait for each other indefinitely.
- The chase camera could jump when frames were advanced by hand in headless runs.

### Project
- New Rules baseline run, a new README, and 11 new browser tests.

## 0.1.0

First release: the simulator, the Jev and Rules drivers, the decision panel, and the benchmark.
